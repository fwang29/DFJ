# DFJ
A small game app I developed during high school :D

## Game Environment prerequisites 
  First thing first, you need java to run the game! Only when jre is installed and correctly set on you computer that the game can run successfully. 

## To Run
  Linux/ Mac:
  - Go to the app directory, open the DFJ.jar file with you Oracle Java Run Time.  
  Windows:
  - Double click the .exe file in the DFJ directory. 

## Game Rules
  游戏很简单，用键盘控制“穹妹”躲子弹
  The game is very simple - just use keyboard to control the mouse to avoid the bullets

  游戏窗口和“穹妹”都有bug，可以利用窗口bug玩爆游戏
  The game window and the mouse control is a bug - you can just move the mouse out of the window to win the game
  
  耐心玩不到1min，也可以玩爆
  The game is super hard that you basically play for less than 1 min, but u can still win the game based on the bug above
  
  内置精简jre（java运行环境），误删
  There's a mini jre (java running environment) inside in the dir, plz do not delete (later I found that the users still needs to specify the java env vars on their own computers - I was too naive)

## Game screencuts 
  can be seen in the issues :)
